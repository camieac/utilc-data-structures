# utilc-data-structures

## Introduction

`utilc-data-structures` contains C implementations of commmon data structures.

Currently available data structures:
- singly linked list
- doubly linked list

## Purpose

This library provides data structure implementations to programmers, for a multitude of applications.

## Code Example
_Provide a code example showing the library API, try to keep the code nice and condensed.
Don't bother with error checking, include comments if necessary.
Provide a link to the example file, as shown below._

A full example, making use of the full `utilc-data-structures` API is available in [example](https://github.com/camieac/utilc-template/blob/master/example/utilc-template-example.c). A shortened example is given below:
```
uc_template_h template;
uc_template_create(template)
```

## Installation
_Provide basic installation instructions, whilst also linking to more detailed installation instructions._

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build, test, and install `utic-data-structures`. Installation instructions are contained within [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/camieac/utilc-template/blob/master/INSTALL.md), and summarised below:
